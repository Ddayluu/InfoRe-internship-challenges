## Challenge 1: Images Classification

### About

In this challenge, you're aksed to create a model or using whatever AI algorithm you want to classify over 10 different breeds of dog. Follow this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p5xgxa9ofmq48vf/dataset.zip?dl=0) to download the dataset. 
Train/valid split information is provided in  `Computer Vision/public.json`. Test data will be published after the deadline and your final score will be evaluated based on it. 

**Make sure you index the classes in the following way, otherwise your final score will be incorrect**

| Class Name  | Index |
|-------------|-------|
