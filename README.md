# InfoRe-internship-challenge

Note: We would prefer you to use [Keras](keras.io) in this project due to its simplicity. However, any other framework is welcome.

## Challenge 1: Images Classification

### About

In this challenge, you're aksed to create a model or using whatever AI algorithm you want to classify over 10 different breeds of dog. Follow this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p5xgxa9ofmq48vf/dataset.zip?dl=0) to download the dataset. 
Train/valid split information is provided in  `Computer Vision/public.json`. Test data will be published after the deadline and your final score will be evaluated based on it. 

**Make sure you index the classes in the following way, otherwise your final score will be incorrect**

| Class Name  | Index |
|-------------|-------|
| bullmastiff | 0     |
| chowchow    | 1     |
| pug         | 2     |
| maltese     | 3     |
| huskysibir  | 4     |
| dachshund   | 5     |
| dalmatian   | 6     |
| corgi       | 7     |
| chihuahua   | 8     |
| yorkshire   | 9     |

## Challenge 2: Intent Classification

### About

The goal of this challenge is to develop a model that can detect the user's intention based on their query or input sentence. This is a basic sentence classification problem with 7 classes (7 intents), with around 2000 sentences each class in the training dataset. All the training data is contained in `intent-train-data`, there are 7 files respected to 7 classes. Each file contains all training examples of each class and one example (sentence) on each line. This dataset is extracted from [nlu-benchmark](https://github.com/snipsco/nlu-benchmark/)

The 7 intents are: (**Make sure you index the classes in the following order, otherwise your final score will be incorrect**) 

0. SearchCreativeWork (e.g. Find me the I, Robot television show),
1. GetWeather (e.g. Is it windy in Boston, MA right now?),
2. BookRestaurant (e.g. I want to book a highly rated restaurant for me and my boyfriend tomorrow night),
3. PlayMusic (e.g. Play the last track from Beyonc√© off Spotify),
4. AddToPlaylist (e.g. Add Diamonds to my roadtrip playlist)
5. RateBook (e.g. Give 6 stars to Of Mice and Men)
6. SearchScreeningEvent (e.g. Check the showtimes for Wonder Woman in Paris)
